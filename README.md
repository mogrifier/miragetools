# This proof of concept was successful. The code is now being ported to NodeJS and being turned into an Electron-based desktop application. You can get some background on that here https://github.com/mogrifier/electron-template and here https://medium.com/codex/electron-desktop-app-template-14c5e9c40b1e.
